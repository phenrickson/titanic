# titanic
This project is the motivating example in a workshop designed to teach the tools of machine learning. In this script I illustrate key concepts for predictive modeling (Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Model Training and Selection, Ensembling) and provide helpful visualizations to provide intuitions for the modeling process.

The submission which results from this tutorial (at time of writing) produces a score of 0.818 on Kaggle, good for top 3% of the competition. Search for 'My CART Will Go On' to view a history of my submissions to the contest.
